[#???]
== {MUST} tri-state booleans (NULL/false/true) are optional booleans

In some cases we need to deal with tri-state boolean attributes, that can take three
instead of two values: NULL, true, false.

To avoid confusion and schema violations tri-state booleans must be defined as optional booleans:
For parameters: `required` must always be `false`.
For schema objects: They must be defined as optional `boolean`.
